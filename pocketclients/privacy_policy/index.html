        <h2 class="card-title h4">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          This Privacy Policy describes how PocketClients ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects
          information when you use our mobile application. PocketClients is designed to help small business owners
          manage their clients and appointments directly on their mobile device.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong>Your data stays on your device.</strong> PocketClients stores all your business data locally 
          on your phone. We do not upload, sync, or store your client information on any external servers.
        </p>

          <li><strong>Appointment Data:</strong> Appointment dates, times, titles, notes, and associated financial information (profit/revenue)</li>
          <li><strong>SMS Messages:</strong> Content of text messages you compose and schedule to send to clients as reminders</li>
          <li><strong>Contacts (with permission):</strong> Access to your device contacts solely for importing client information into the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text mt-3"><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports and diagnostic information. This helps us identify and fix bugs. Crash reports may include:</p>

          <li>General usage statistics</li>

        <h2 class="card-title h4">How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h2 class="card-title h4">Information Sharing</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your client data with anyone.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Your client information, appointments, and messages remain exclusively on your device. The only information transmitted from the app is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SMS Messages:</strong> Sent through your phone's standard SMS service to recipients you specify</li>
          <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Anonymous diagnostic data sent to Firebase Crashlytics (Google) to help us improve app stability</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card mb-4">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h2 class="card-title h4">Data Security</h2>
        <p class="card-text">We take data security seriously:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local Encryption:</strong> Your data is stored in an encrypted database on your device using industry-standard AES-256 encryption (SQLCipher)</li>
          <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> Your data is never uploaded to external servers, eliminating cloud-based security risks</li>
          <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features (PIN, fingerprint, face recognition)</li>
          <li><strong>No Backups:</strong> The app disables Android's automatic backup feature to prevent unencrypted data from being stored in cloud backups</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text mt-3"><strong>Important:</strong> Because data is stored only on your device, if you uninstall the app, factory reset your phone, or lose your device, your data cannot be recovered. We recommend periodically noting important client information elsewhere as a precaution.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="card mb-4">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h2 class="card-title h4">Your Rights</h2>
        <p class="card-text">You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is visible and accessible within the app</li>
          <li><strong>Modification:</strong> You can edit any client or appointment information at any time</li>
          <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual clients, appointments, or uninstall the app to remove all data</li>
          <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can revoke any app permission through your device settings at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text">Since we don't store your data on our servers, there is no need to request data from us—you already have it all on your device.</p>
